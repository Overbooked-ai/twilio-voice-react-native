## Twilio Voice SDK Integration Issue

### Issue Description
We're encountering a NullPointerException in the Twilio Voice React Native SDK when running on Android:

```
Attempt to read from field 'com.twiliovoicereactnative.JSEventEmitter com.twiliovoicereactnative.VoiceApplicationProxy.jsEventEmitter' on a null object reference in method 'com.twiliovoicereactnative.JSEventEmitter com.twiliovoicereactnative.VoiceApplicationProxy.getJSEventEmitter()'
```

This error occurs during the initialization of the Twilio Voice module, specifically when native code tries to access the `JSEventEmitter` instance via `VoiceApplicationProxy.getJSEventEmitter()`.

### Root Cause Analysis (Updated)

The core issue lies in the initialization timing and context handling within the Expo integration:

1.  **`ExpoApplicationLifecycleListener`**: This listener correctly creates the `VoiceApplicationProxy` singleton instance and calls its `onCreate` method when the application starts.
2.  **`VoiceApplicationProxy.onCreate()`**: This method correctly instantiates the `JSEventEmitter` object.
3.  **Missing Context**: However, the `JSEventEmitter` requires the `ReactApplicationContext` to actually *send* events back to JavaScript. This context is *not* set during the initial creation in `VoiceApplicationProxy.onCreate()` because the application lifecycle listener runs very early, before the React Native instance (and thus the context) is fully ready.
4.  **`ExpoModule.kt`**: When methods in `ExpoModule.kt` (like `voice_connect`) are called, they trigger actions within the Twilio SDK (e.g., through `CallListenerProxy`) that attempt to use the `JSEventEmitter` via `VoiceApplicationProxy.getJSEventEmitter()`. Although the emitter object exists, it lacks the necessary `ReactApplicationContext` set via its `setContext()` method, leading to internal errors or potentially the observed NPE when `getJSEventEmitter()` is called if internal checks fail implicitly.

Essentially, the `JSEventEmitter` was created but not fully configured with the React context before it was needed.

### Solution Implemented

To resolve this, I modified `android/src/main/java/com/twiliovoicereactnative/ExpoModule.kt`:

1.  Added an `OnCreate` block to the `ModuleDefinition`.
2.  Inside `OnCreate`, which runs when the Expo module is initialized and the `ReactApplicationContext` is available:
    *   Retrieved the singleton `JSEventEmitter` instance using `VoiceApplicationProxy.getJSEventEmitter()`.
    *   Called `emitter.setContext(appContext.reactContext)` to provide the necessary context to the emitter.

This ensures the `JSEventEmitter` is fully configured *before* any SDK functions that rely on it are invoked.

### Next Steps for Developer

1.  **Pull Changes**: Get the latest version of the code, including the modified `ExpoModule.kt`.
2.  **Rebuild**: Clean and rebuild the Android application:
    ```bash
    cd android
    ./gradlew clean
    cd ..
    npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean # or yarn expo prebuild...
    npx expo run:android # or yarn expo run:android
    ```
3.  **Test**: Verify that the `NullPointerException` related to `JSEventEmitter` no longer occurs during initialization or when making/receiving calls.
4.  **Monitor**: Keep an eye out for any other potential initialization-related issues, although this fix addresses the specific NPE reported.

### Potential Solutions (Original - Kept for reference)

1.  ~~**Update the Twilio Voice SDK**: Check if there's a newer version of the SDK that has better Expo support.~~ (Fix applied to fork)
2.  ~~**Fix the Application Lifecycle**: Ensure that the `VoiceApplicationProxy` is properly initialized before the React Native module tries to use it. This might involve modifying the `ExpoApplicationLifecycleListener.java` file.~~ (Initialization was okay, context setting was the issue, fixed in `ExpoModule.kt`)
3.  **Check the Expo Config Plugin**: Verify that the Twilio Android config plugin (`withTwilioAndroid.js`) is correctly setting up all required components. (Still relevant if other issues arise)
4.  ~~**Review the ExpoModule Implementation**: The `ExpoModule.ts` implementation might need adjustments to ensure proper initialization order.~~ (Native Android (`.kt`) module was the issue)
