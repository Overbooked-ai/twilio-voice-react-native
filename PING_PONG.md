## Update 8: Gradle Build Error Fixed (Attempt 2)

**Issue:**

The previous fix using `afterEvaluate` in the fork's `android/build.gradle` was ineffective. The Android build still failed with the Gradle error about missing task dependency:

```
Reason: Task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:packageDebugResources' uses this output of task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:generateDebugResValues' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency.
```

**Analysis:**

The `afterEvaluate` block might not reliably configure dynamically generated tasks for all build variants. A more robust approach is needed.

**Solution Implemented (Attempt 2):**

I have replaced the `afterEvaluate` block in the fork's `android/build.gradle` with a different approach:

- It now iterates through `android.libraryVariants.all`.
- For each variant, it uses `tasks.named()` to get references to the `generate<VariantName>ResValues` and `package<VariantName>Resources` tasks.
- It explicitly sets `packageTask.dependsOn(generateTask)` within the configuration block for the packaging task.

This method hooks into Gradle's task configuration more directly and should reliably establish the dependency for all variants (debug, release, etc.).

**Next Steps for Developer:**

1.  **Pull Changes**: Get the *latest* version of the code from the fork repository (`guyrosen/twilio-voice-react-native`), which includes the updated `android/build.gradle`.
2.  **Clean and Rebuild**: Perform a clean build again:
    ```bash
    cd android
    ./gradlew clean
    cd ..
    npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
    npx expo run:android
    ```
3.  **Test**: Verify that the Gradle build error is finally resolved and the Android app builds successfully.

## Update 7: Gradle Build Error Persists (Attempt 1 Failed)

**Issue:** Android build failed due to missing Gradle task dependency, despite the `afterEvaluate` fix attempt.
**Analysis:** The `afterEvaluate` approach was insufficient.
**Request:** Revisit Gradle configuration for a more robust dependency declaration.

---

## Update 6: Gradle Build Error Fixed (Attempt 1)

**Issue:** Android build failed due to missing Gradle task dependency (`package...Resources` vs `generate...ResValues`) in the fork.
**Analysis:** Internal build configuration issue in the fork's `android/build.gradle`.
**Solution Implemented:** Added `afterEvaluate` block in fork's `android/build.gradle` to set `dependsOn`.
**Result:** The fix was ineffective; the build still fails with the same error.

---

## Update 5: Gradle Build Error in Fork (Identified)

**Issue:** Build failed with Gradle error about missing dependency between `packageDebugResources` and `generateDebugResValues` in the fork.
**Analysis:** Confirmed internal build configuration issue in the fork's `android/build.gradle`.
**Request:** Fix the Gradle task dependency.

## Update 4: Config Plugins Missing from Package (Fixed by Fork Update & Local Copy)

**Issue:** `expo prebuild` failed to resolve config plugins.
**Solution Implemented:** Added plugins to `files` array in fork's `package.json`, copied plugins locally, fixed exports.
**Result:** `prebuild` passed.

---

## Update 3: Build Failure During Installation (Correcting Dependency - Fixed)

**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Implemented:** Corrected `expo-modules-core` version to `^1.11.0` in fork.
**Result:** Installation succeeded.

---

## Update 2: Build Failure During Installation (Attempt 1: TypeScript Version - Fixed)

**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Attempted:** Updated `typescript` to `~4.9.5` in fork.
**Result:** Failure persisted until `expo-modules-core` version was also corrected.

## Original: Twilio Voice SDK Integration Issue (Context - Fixed)

**Issue Description:** `NullPointerException` on `JSEventEmitter` during initialization.
**Solution Implemented (Fixed):** Modified `ExpoModule.kt` in fork to set context during `OnCreate`.
