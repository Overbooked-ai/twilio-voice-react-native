## Update 14: Gradle Build Error Fix Attempt 5 (Input/Output Declaration)

**Issue:**

The Android build *still* fails with the Gradle error regarding missing task dependencies between `:twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:generateDebugResValues` and `:twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:packageDebugResources`. Previous attempts using various Gradle configuration methods (`afterEvaluate`, `tasks.matching`, `dependsOn`) within the fork have been ineffective.

```
Reason: Task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:packageDebugResources' uses this output of task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:generateDebugResValues' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency.
```

**Analysis:**

This persistent error indicates a definite misconfiguration *within the `twilio-voice-react-native-sdk` library's `android/build.gradle` file*. It is not an issue with the consuming application's build setup. The library fails to correctly declare its internal task dependencies according to Gradle requirements, specifically for AGP 7.4.x.

Given the failure of previous standard approaches, the most robust remaining method recommended by Gradle itself is to explicitly declare the *outputs* of the generating task (`generate...ResValues`) as *inputs* for the consuming task (`package...Resources`).

**Solution Implemented (Attempt 5 - Standard Input/Output Fix):**

In the fork's `android/build.gradle`:
1.  The previous `afterEvaluate` block (and other prior attempts) were **removed**.
2.  A **new configuration block** was added using `android.libraryVariants.all`.
3.  Inside this block, it uses `tasks.named(...)` to get `TaskProvider`s for `generate<Variant>ResValues` and `package<Variant>Resources`.
4.  Crucially, it configures the `package` task to declare the output directory of the `generate` task as one of its input directories (`packageTask.inputs.dir(outputDir).withPathSensitivity(...)`). This explicitly tells Gradle about the relationship.
5.  Logging (`project.logger.quiet(...)`) was included again to verify execution during the build (requires `--info` flag).

**This input/output declaration is the standard, preferred way to resolve such implicit dependency errors in Gradle.**

**Next Steps for Developer:**

**It is crucial to understand that this is an internal build configuration issue within the forked library. The fix applied is the standard Gradle solution.**

1.  **Pull Changes**: Get the **absolute latest** version of the code from the fork repository (`guyrosen/twilio-voice-react-native`), which includes the updated `android/build.gradle` with the input/output fix.
2.  **Perform a Clean Build (Essential)**:
    ```bash
    # In your project directory
    echo "Ensure you pulled the latest fork changes!"
    rm -rf node_modules
    pnpm install # or yarn install / npm install
    echo "Cleaning Android build..."
    cd android
    ./gradlew clean
    cd ..
    echo "Running Expo prebuild (clean)..."
    npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
    echo "Attempting Android build with info logging..."
    # Run with info flag to see logs
    npx expo run:android --info 
    ```
3.  **Check Build Logs**: Carefully examine the build output for:
    *   The log messages starting with `AGP Task Dependency Fix (Input/Output):`. This confirms the fix was applied.
    *   The *absence* of the specific task dependency error.
4.  **Verify Build Success**: If the build completes successfully, the internal library issue is resolved.
5.  **Test**: Proceed with testing the core Twilio functionality and the original NPE fix.

**If the build *still* fails with the exact same error after ensuring you have pulled the latest changes and performed a clean build:**

*   **Double-check the Fork Version:** Ensure your package manager is *definitely* installing the very latest commit from the `main` branch of the fork.
*   **Gradle Cache:** Consider clearing the Gradle cache (`~/.gradle/caches/`) as a last resort, although `./gradlew clean` should typically suffice.
*   **Report Back:** If it fails again under these conditions, report back with the *full* `--info` build log. The problem might be an extremely unusual interaction with the specific build environment or AGP version requiring even deeper investigation within the library's Gradle file.

*History of Previous Attempts (Updates 6-13): Multiple attempts using various Gradle configuration APIs failed.* 

--- 

## Update 5 - 13: Gradle Build Error in Fork (Multiple Fix Attempts Failed)
**Issue:** Build failed with Gradle error about missing dependency.
**Analysis:** Internal build configuration issue in fork's `android/build.gradle`. Various standard fixes ineffective.
**Request:** Apply more robust fix.

--- 

## Update 4: Config Plugins Missing from Package (Fixed)
**Issue:** `expo prebuild` failed to resolve config plugins.
**Solution Implemented:** Added plugins to `files` array in fork, updated local app.
**Result:** `prebuild` passed.

--- 

## Update 3: Build Failure During Installation (Correcting Dependency - Fixed)
**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Implemented:** Corrected `expo-modules-core` version.
**Result:** Installation succeeded.

--- 

## Update 2: Build Failure During Installation (Attempt 1: TypeScript Version - Fixed)
**Issue:** Installation failed during `prepare` script (`bob build`) due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Attempted:** Updated `typescript` to `~4.9.5`.
**Result:** Failure persisted (Issue was dependency version).

--- 

## Original: Twilio Voice SDK Integration Issue (Context - Fixed)
**Issue Description:** `NullPointerException` on `JSEventEmitter` during initialization.
**Root Cause Analysis (Fixed):** `JSEventEmitter` created but `ReactApplicationContext` not set before use.
**Solution Implemented (Fixed):** Modified `ExpoModule.kt` to set context during `OnCreate`.
