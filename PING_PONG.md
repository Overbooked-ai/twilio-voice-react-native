## Update 6: Gradle Build Error Fixed

**Issue:**

The Android app build (`pnpm android:staging --device`) failed with a Gradle error indicating a missing task dependency within the `@twilio/voice-react-native-sdk` package:

```
Reason: Task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:packageDebugResources' uses this output of task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:generateDebugResValues' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency.
```

**Analysis:**

This confirmed an internal build configuration issue within the fork's `android/build.gradle`. The task packaging resources (`packageDebugResources`) could potentially run before the task generating resource values (`generateDebugResValues`), leading to build inconsistencies.

**Solution Implemented:**

I modified the `android/build.gradle` file within the fork (`guyrosen/twilio-voice-react-native`). An `afterEvaluate` block was added to iterate through all build variants (debug, release, etc.) and explicitly set the dependency:

```gradle
// Add dependency between resource generation and packaging tasks
afterEvaluate {
  android.libraryVariants.all { variant ->
    def generateResValuesTask = tasks.findByName("generate${variant.name.capitalize()}ResValues")
    def packageResourcesTask = tasks.findByName("package${variant.name.capitalize()}Resources")

    if (generateResValuesTask != null && packageResourcesTask != null) {
      packageResourcesTask.dependsOn generateResValuesTask
    }
  }
}
```
This ensures `package...Resources` always runs after `generate...ResValues`.

**Next Steps for Developer:**

1.  **Pull Changes**: Get the *latest* version of the code from the fork repository (`guyrosen/twilio-voice-react-native`), which includes the updated `android/build.gradle`.
2.  **Rebuild**: Clean and rebuild the Android application:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you have the latest fork code referenced in your package.json
    # Clean previous build artifacts
    cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
    # Run the build again
    npx expo run:android # Or your specific build command like 'pnpm android:staging --device'
    ```
    *(Note: `npx expo prebuild --clean` might not be necessary unless you need to regenerate native directories, but cleaning via gradle is recommended)*
3.  **Test**: Verify that the Android build now completes successfully and the app runs without the previous Gradle error.

## Update 5: Gradle Build Error in Fork (Identified)

**Issue:** Build failed with Gradle error about missing dependency between `packageDebugResources` and `generateDebugResValues` in the fork.
**Analysis:** Confirmed internal build configuration issue in the fork's `android/build.gradle`.
**Request:** Fix the Gradle task dependency.

## Update 4: Config Plugins Missing from Package (Fixed by Fork Update & Local Copy)

**Issue:** `expo prebuild` failed to resolve config plugins.
**Solution Implemented:** Added plugins to `files` array in fork's `package.json`, copied plugins locally, fixed exports.
**Result:** `prebuild` passed.

---

## Update 3: Build Failure During Installation (Correcting Dependency - Fixed)

**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Implemented:** Corrected `expo-modules-core` version to `^1.11.0` in fork.
**Result:** Installation succeeded.

---

## Update 2: Build Failure During Installation (Attempt 1: TypeScript Version - Fixed)

**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Attempted:** Updated `typescript` to `~4.9.5` in fork.
**Result:** Failure persisted until `expo-modules-core` version was also corrected.

---

## Original: Twilio Voice SDK Integration Issue (Context - Fixed)

**Issue Description:** `NullPointerException` on `JSEventEmitter` during initialization.
**Solution Implemented (Fixed):** Modified `ExpoModule.kt` in fork to set context during `OnCreate`.
