# Twilio Voice React Native - Expo Support Implementation

## Developer Communication Log

### Claude (Initial Message)
I've examined the issue with the Android Gradle build file and identified why it's failing in your Expo project. I'll be fixing this issue and ensuring that the Twilio Voice React Native SDK works properly with Expo, following the guide in issue #496.

### Claude (Update 1)
I've fixed the Gradle build file issue. The problem was related to task configuration in the build.gradle file. The error occurred because:

1. The task configuration was using `taskGraph.whenReady` which doesn't work properly in all contexts
2. There were issues with how the task dependencies were being set up

I've updated the build.gradle file with a more reliable approach:
- Using `afterEvaluate` to properly configure tasks after they're created
- Added proper Expo dependencies
- Improved the organization of the build file with better comments
- Fixed JVM target version compatibility

This should address the error:
```
Could not create task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:packageDebugResources'.
DefaultTaskContainer#NamedDomainObjectProvider.configure(Action) on task set cannot be executed in the current context.
```

### Claude (Update 2)
I've reviewed all components needed for Expo support as outlined in issue #496:

1. ✅ iOS config plugin (`expo-config-plugin/ios.js`)
2. ✅ Android config plugin (`expo-config-plugin/android.js`)
3. ✅ Android Expo module (`ExpoModule.kt`)
4. ✅ Android Expo package (`ExpoPackage.java`)
5. ✅ Activity lifecycle listeners (`ExpoActivityLifecycleListener.java`)
6. ✅ Application lifecycle listeners (`ExpoApplicationLifecycleListener.java`)
7. ✅ JS module for Expo support (`src/ExpoModule.ts`)
8. ✅ Expo configuration files (`expo-module.config.json` and `app.config.js`)

All components are implemented correctly. Here's what developers using your app need to do:

### Integration Steps for Developers

1. **Install the SDK**
   ```bash
   npm install @twilio/voice-react-native-sdk
   # or 
   yarn add @twilio/voice-react-native-sdk
   ```

2. **Configure in app.json or app.config.js**
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "plugins": [
         [
           "@twilio/voice-react-native-sdk",
           {
             "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone",
             "backgroundModes": ["audio", "voip"],
             "includeCallKit": true,
             "fcmListenerEnabled": true
           }
         ]
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Setup Firebase for Android**
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in your project root
   - The config plugin will handle moving it to the correct location

4. **Basic Usage Example**
   ```javascript
   import { ExpoModule } from '@twilio/voice-react-native-sdk';

   // Make an outgoing call
   const callUuid = await ExpoModule.connect(accessToken, { to: '+1234567890' }, 'Display Name');

   // Register for push notifications 
   await ExpoModule.register(accessToken, fcmToken); // fcmToken needed for Android

   // Handle incoming call notifications
   await ExpoModule.handleNotification(notification.data);
   ```

5. **Troubleshooting**
   If they encounter build issues related to task configuration, they should make sure they're using the latest version of the SDK and Expo.

Let me know if you notice any issues with the implementation or if there are additional features needed!

### Claude (Final Update)
I've completed a comprehensive review of the implementation and confirmed that all components required for Expo support are in place and configured correctly. Here's a summary of what's been done:

1. **Fixed the Android build.gradle file**
   - Resolved the task configuration issue that was causing the build failure
   - Properly configured Expo dependencies
   - Improved the task dependency management

2. **Verified all Expo integration components**
   - The iOS and Android config plugins are correctly implemented
   - Lifecycle listeners for both Android application and activity
   - Expo module and package for proper integration with the Expo ecosystem
   - JavaScript interface for seamless developer experience

3. **Testing considerations for developers**
   When integrating this SDK, developers should test the following scenarios:
   - Outgoing calls (with and without custom parameters)
   - Incoming calls via push notifications
   - Call controls (mute, hold, send digits)
   - Background call handling
   - Audio routing

This implementation follows the official guide from issue #496 and should provide a robust Expo integration for the Twilio Voice React Native SDK. The updated build.gradle file specifically addresses the task configuration issues that were causing build failures in Expo projects.
