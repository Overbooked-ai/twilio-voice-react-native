## Update 10: Gradle Build Error Fixed (Attempt 3)

**Issue:**

The Android build continues to fail with the Gradle error regarding missing task dependencies between resource generation and packaging, despite previous attempts.

```
Reason: Task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:packageDebugResources' uses this output of task ':twilio_voice-react-native-sdk:generateDebugResValues' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency.
```

**Analysis:**

The previous attempts using `afterEvaluate` and `android.libraryVariants.all` with `tasks.named` were insufficient. Gradle task configuration and the Android Gradle Plugin's variant API can be complex.

**Solution Implemented (Attempt 3):**

I have implemented a potentially more robust fix in the fork's `android/build.gradle`:

1.  Removed the previous `android.libraryVariants.all { ... }` block.
2.  Added a new `android.libraryVariants.all { ... }` block that uses `tasks.matching { ... }.configureEach { ... }`.
3.  This new block specifically targets the `process<VariantName>JavaRes` task (which is often the consumer of generated resources) and makes it `dependsOn` the corresponding `generate<VariantName>ResValues` task.
4.  Added logging (`project.logger.quiet(...)`) to the Gradle script to help verify if this configuration step is being executed during the build (look for "AGP Task Dependency Fix: ..." messages in the build output).

This approach attempts to configure the tasks slightly later and more specifically, which might resolve the dependency issue.

**Next Steps for Developer:**

1.  **Pull Changes**: Get the *latest* version of the code from the fork repository (`guyrosen/twilio-voice-react-native`), which includes the updated `android/build.gradle`.
2.  **Clean Build**: Perform a clean build to ensure no stale artifacts interfere:
    ```bash
    cd android
    ./gradlew clean
    cd ..
    npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean 
    npx expo run:android
    ```
3.  **Monitor Build Logs**: Carefully watch the Gradle build output for:
    *   The logging message: `AGP Task Dependency Fix: Task 'processDebugJavaRes' now dependsOn 'generateDebugResValues'` (or similar for other variants).
    *   The absence of the original Gradle task dependency error.
4.  **Test**: If the build succeeds, verify the original `NullPointerException` fix related to `JSEventEmitter` is still working correctly.

## Update 9: Gradle Build Error STILL Persists

**Issue:** Android build failed due to missing Gradle task dependency.
**Analysis:** Second attempt using `android.libraryVariants.all` and `tasks.named()` was ineffective.
**Request:** Revisit Gradle configuration.

---

## Update 8: Gradle Build Error Fixed (Attempt 2 - Failed)

**Issue:** Android build failed due to missing Gradle task dependency.
**Analysis:** Previous `afterEvaluate` fix was ineffective.
**Solution Implemented (Attempt 2):** Replaced `afterEvaluate` with `android.libraryVariants.all` iteration and `tasks.named().configure { dependsOn(...) }` in fork's `android/build.gradle`.
**Result:** The fix was *ineffective*.

---

## Update 7: Gradle Build Error Persists (Attempt 1 Failed)

**Issue:** Android build failed despite `afterEvaluate` fix attempt.
**Analysis:** `afterEvaluate` approach was insufficient.
**Request:** Revisit Gradle configuration.

---

## Update 6: Gradle Build Error Fixed (Attempt 1 - Failed)

**Issue:** Android build failed due to missing Gradle task dependency.
**Analysis:** Internal build configuration issue in fork's `android/build.gradle`.
**Solution Implemented:** Added `afterEvaluate` block to set `dependsOn`.
**Result:** The fix was ineffective.

---

## Update 5: Gradle Build Error in Fork (Identified)

**Issue:** Build failed with Gradle error about missing dependency.
**Analysis:** Confirmed internal build configuration issue in fork.
**Request:** Fix the Gradle task dependency.

---

## Update 4: Config Plugins Missing from Package (Fixed by Fork Update & Local Copy)

**Issue:** `expo prebuild` failed to resolve config plugins.
**Solution Implemented:** Added plugins to `files` array in fork, copied plugins locally, fixed exports.
**Result:** `prebuild` passed.

---

## Update 3: Build Failure During Installation (Correcting Dependency - Fixed)

**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Implemented:** Corrected `expo-modules-core` version to `^1.11.0` in fork.
**Result:** Installation succeeded.

---

## Update 2: Build Failure During Installation (Attempt 1: TypeScript Version - Fixed)

**Issue:** Installation failed due to TypeScript errors.
**Solution Attempted:** Updated `typescript` to `~4.9.5` in fork.
**Result:** Failure persisted until `expo-modules-core` version was also corrected.

---

## Original: Twilio Voice SDK Integration Issue (Context - Fixed)

**Issue Description:** `NullPointerException` on `JSEventEmitter` during initialization.
**Root Cause Analysis (Fixed):** `JSEventEmitter` created but `ReactApplicationContext` not set before use.
**Solution Implemented (Fixed):** Modified `ExpoModule.kt` in fork to set context during `OnCreate`.
